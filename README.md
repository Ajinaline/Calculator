To make things work, here's how it works:
1.  The calculator works at a basic level so if you input the numbers and tap on the equals sign, you'd get the correct answer
2.  If you hold down the '%' button, it takes you to your contacts and you can then select the contact you want for their number
3.  Now, if you tap the equals button, it should display the phone number of the contact you selected
4.  This is a one time use so you would have to reselect the phone number again (this is so you can fool them into thinking it's a real working calculator)
